Here will be simple software renderer.

TODO:
1) Frustum-culling (only near-z plane)
2) Lighting
3) Z-checking with z-buffer
4) Scene graph
5) config -> script file
6) Fix node transformations
7) Scriptable scene objects

note: resources need to be in the executable directory, or this dir may be passed explicitly to the renderer through command line
for example:
$ ./client-tk ../../resources
Otherwise you'll get nothing
